# gimme-ls-cli

> Because `ls` > `dir`, and it makes Windows users happy.

## Usage

Type `lss` to call `dir`.

```
C:\Users\you> lss
```

## Contribution

If you know how to safely add `ls` as a command without it confusing bash then please make a [PR](https://github.com/seriema/gimme-ls-cli/pulls). Until then I'll keep it as `lss`.

## Thanks

This is mostly a fun node-version of my friend's [givemels](https://github.com/OakNinja/givemels) bat file.
